This is a python project by 2 colleagues / dungeon masters. The idea is two pronged:
In the first place is it for both of us a way to learn how to program with python.
But to learn to program you need  project, Something to work towards. That brings us to the second prong.
As Dungeon masters we felt the need for a program that would keep track of initiative. There are a lot of options
For apps and software, but never annything to our liking. So this created the idea for this project.

The first level of this project would be a simple initiative tracker. sorting players and monsters according to innitiative 
and keeping track of HP and Conditions.

At later levels (if the first one succeeds), perhaps a way of preparing sessions and taking notes during sessions.
